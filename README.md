# Open-Source-Dynamic-Motion
Welcome to my first github post! 

Hi - I am TJ Moon. A 1st year MID at RISD, focusing on wearable technology and CAD/CAM prototyping. This "Dynamic Motion" project is for a open source hardware course taught by Ben Jurgensen (Critic Sculpture/ID). I will be learning by doing, and Github is where I will be documenting, publishing and sharing my work. With the help of my friend Bayan and Ben, my goal is create and control create multi-dimension motion, inorder to connected to other systems and functions.

Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:tmoon@risd.edu">tmoon@risd.edu</a> if you have any questions or inqeries. 

best,

TJ
