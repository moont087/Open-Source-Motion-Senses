# Open-Source-Dynamic-Motion
Welcome to my first github post! 

My name is TJ, I am a MID 1st year at RISD. This project is for a class on open source hardware taught by Ben Jurgensen (Critic Sculpture/ID). I will be learning by doing, and Github is where I will be documenting, publishing and sharing my work. With the help of my friend Bayan and Ben, my goal is create and control create multi-dimension motion, that can be connected to other systems and functions.

Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:tmoon@risd.edu">tmoon@risd.edu</a> if you have any questions or inqeries. 
I don't know where this will ~ Thank you for visiting!

best,
TJ
