# Open-Source-Dynamic-Motion
Welcome to my first github post! 
My name is TJ, I am a MID 1st year at RISD. This project is for a class on open source hardware taught by Ben Jurgensen (Critic Sculpture/ID). I will be learning by doing, and use Github to try and organize how to utilize and contribute to open source communities. With the help of my friend Bayan and Ben, my goal is create and control create multi-dimension motion, that can be connected to other systems and functions.

I don't know where this will go, but I am going to document my findings, research and files. Please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:tmoon@risd.edu">tmoon@risd.edu</a> if you have any questions or inqeries. Thank you for visiting!

best,
TJ
